### ⌚ Hours

* I prefer to _work remotely_. My ideal work week would have _2 - 3 days in the office_, and _2 - 3 days working from home_, or a coworking space.

* Speaking of coworking spaces: **let me know** if you'd like to explore a new one, or if you have recommendations! I will spend at least a couple hours in one in each city I travel to. Some favorites:

> * [Flux](https://www.fluxperth.com/) - _Perth, WA_
> * [Revolver](http://revolvercoworking.com.au/) - Prahran, VIC_
> * [Hub](https://www.hubaustralia.com/) - Sydney, VIC_

## `Philosophy`

### 🔥 Dont burn out.
Most of the people i've met who are at the top of their game, their greatest fear is that next year they wont be. That they'll say something, or do something, or make a decision that will be so unpopular that they'll lose their gig or someone will surpass them. Dont have that fear. Your life isn't tied in to Moores Law; Take a holiday, finish that book, and dont let life pass you by from the peripherals of your laptop screen. 

### 📊 More data, less ego.
We live in a very philosophically divided time. The only way to win is by bringing data to opinion fights; and making *every* decision data-driven.

### ✈ Seek out the unknown.
Paraphrasing Anthony Bourdain a bit, but: Life isn’t always pretty. It isn’t always comfortable. Sometimes it hurts, it even breaks your heart. But that’s OK. The journey changes you; it should change you... You take something with you. Hopefully, you leave something good behind.

### ✊ I dont have to agree with you to like or respect you.
Just because someone you work with is a miserable, treacherous, self-serving, capricious, and corrupt asshole shouldn't prevent you from enjoying their company, working with them, or finding them entertaining.

### 📢 Communication is 🔑.
If you can't communicate your findings or collaborate with others, your career will be over before it begins. Science and engineering are team sports.

### 📈 Choose growth opportunities.
"Try never to be the smartest person in the room. And if you are, I suggest you invite smarter people… or find a different room." Always choose an opportunity to learn, to grow new skills.

### 👭 Nurture and build communities.
Communities are powerful, fragile things and must be nurtured over time. Be kind; have empathy; respect differing paces. **Everything** is about the community: making it collaborative, caring; a collective. A group of passionate people who care about each other's success. If you can build this, you can build anything.

### 🎁 Give without expecting a return.
Somebody once told me that throughout a career, you'll meet people — and you'll learn, help, support, and encourage them, not even thinking about it. But those influences _will_ change lives; and if you're lucky, you'll find out later.

### 🙏 Believe in people, not acronyms.
Acronyms don't equate to worth, intelligence, or character. I have met many brilliant humans without a degree; and PhD's without creativity, empathy, or work ethic. I'll choose the former, every time.
